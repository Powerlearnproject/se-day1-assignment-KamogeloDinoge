Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Enfineering is a systematic application or approach to designing, developing and maintaining of quality software systems and it also involves testing and deployment and maintenance of software products. 
The importance of Software in the technology industry is that it enables the creation software applications as well as systems that power various aspects pf modern life like communication, healthcare, entertainment, commerce. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages like Fortra,C, The advent of structure programming in the 1970s and the rise of methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle has several phases which are the following:
1.Requirements where you gather and document user needs and system requirements 
2. The Design where you create high-level and detatailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
3. The Implementation whereby it's writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing where you conduct various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements 
5. The Deployment where you will now be releasing the software to users or customers 
6. Maintenance where you provide ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall e.g design implementation like large-scale construction projects
Agile is iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibity, collaboaration and responding to change eexample is building mobile apps and launching new websites


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software Developer is resposible for writing code and implementing software solutions
2. The quality assurance engineer is the one that ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
3. A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The Integrated Development Environments is software that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code for example Visual Studios and Intelij IDEA
Visual Control Sysytems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinate work among team members examples include Git and subversion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
The Challenges that Software Engineers face are changing requirements, Tights deadlines, Technical Debt Strategies to overcome these challeges would include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritize tasks and reqular reassesment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
There 3 different types of testing which are Unit Testing thats all about testing individual components or modules of software, Integration test which is testing interactins between different components or subsystems and lastly System testing which is testing the entire software as a whole.
it is important to do testing as it is a crucial aspect of QA.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of carefully crafting input prompts to guide AI particularly large language models to generate the desired output by providing specific context, instructions and examples.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague question might be asking AI "tell me about skincare" and it might give you a general answer but if you ask "Tell me more about different skincare products and how to effectively use them" then you'll get a more focused answer
